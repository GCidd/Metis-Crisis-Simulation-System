# Metis: Crisis Simulation System
###### Metis, one of the elder Okeanides and the Titan-goddess of good counsel, planning, cunning and wisdom.

Metis is a crisis simulation system developed in the context of my Master's Thesis, at the Master of Philosophy Postgraduate studies program - "Advanced Technologies in Informatics and Computers" at the International Hellenic University.

## Dynamic Environment Design and Crisis Management
Metis is a multi-agent based crisis simulation system that provides the ability to design and simulate dynamic indoor crisis scenarios.

### 1st Layer
#### Dynamic Environment Development 
Design and setup the entire environment and building to be evacuated, dynamically.

### 2nd Layer
#### Scenario Design  
Place pedestrians (agents) in different parts of the building, designate which doors are exits, mark areas of the environment in which the pedestrians will be safe and place fires in different places.

### 3rd Layer
#### Evacuation Simulation 
Choose when the simulation automatically ends and manage a dynamically changing crisis. The evacuation process and the modules responsible for the simulation exploit Reinforcement Learning models.
